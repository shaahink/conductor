# Conductor (Baton worktree) — session handoff

## What this is
Conductor is an autonomous multi-session engineering orchestrator (C# / .NET, Spectre.Console). It
spawns headless agent sessions, verifies work independently (gate battery + git commits + tracker
diff), is fully resumable, and reports to `.conductor/REPORT.md`. This worktree (`feat/baton`) hosts
**Baton — Conductor v2**: Conductor improving itself.

## This worktree
- **Path:** `C:\Code\conductor-baton`  **Branch:** `feat/baton`
- **Do NOT touch:** `C:\Code\conductor` (master, the stable DRIVER) or the live `C:\Code\DevContext2-ui`
  Loom run (separate repo + lock).
- **Driver:** the STABLE `C:\Code\conductor\bin\conductor.exe` (built from master). The tool improving
  Conductor is never the tool under edit.

## Read order
1. `C:\Code\conductor\NEXT-ERA.md` — strategic roadmap for Era v3 (post-Baton)
2. `CONDUCTOR-START.md` — tracker, all 67/67 checkpoints DONE
3. `docs/qa-reports/CONDUCTOR-FINAL.md` — final audit + Needs Human checklist
4. `docs/baton/BATON-BRIEF.md` — v2 design authority (reference)

## Deliverables authored on this branch (plan, not yet executed)
- `docs/baton/BATON-BRIEF.md` + `docs/baton/stages/B0.md`…`B12.md`
- `docs/baton/tooling/` (B0 drafts: editorconfig, Directory.Build.props, Directory.Packages.props,
  Meziantou ruleset rationale) + `docs/baton/adr/` (created in B0.6)
- `CONDUCTOR-START.md` (tracker — verified parses: 65 checkpoints, 13 stages)
- `plans/conductor.self.plan.json` + `plans/baton-templates/` (session/fix/resume/audit/advisor,
  tuned: value-only gates, audit-fixes-leftovers, fix-session leftover sweep)
- `examples/README.md` + `examples/shamshir/parity-pipeline.TRACKER.md` (drivability proof)

## How to run (with the STABLE driver)
```powershell
C:\Code\conductor\bin\conductor.exe run --dry-run -p .conductor\plans\conductor-debt.plan.json
C:\Code\conductor\bin\conductor.exe run         -p .conductor\plans\conductor-debt.plan.json
```

## QA protocol (added 2026-07-09)
- Skip previous-session QA when last session ended `advanced` or `progress` with all gates green.
- Run QA only when last session was `gatesRed`, `stalled`, `noProgress`, or `interrupted`.
- **Tracker rule:** always update BOTH handoff block AND checkpoint row (DONE + commit + evidence). If row stays TODO, conductor re-launches the same stage.

## Current state (2026-07-11, updated mid-F6)
- **Baton v2 COMPLETE** — 77 sessions, 67/67 checkpoints DONE, status=completed.
- **Foreman v3 ACTIVE** — 23/40 checkpoints DONE, F0-F5 confirmed, F6 (Ink TUI) IN PROGRESS (first pass shipped, not yet integration-tested or committed — see below).
- **Branch:** `feat/foreman` is the active branch; `feat/baton` is the worktree.
- **Driver:** `C:\Code\conductor\bin\conductor.exe run -p plans\conductor-foreman.plan.json`
- **Read order:** `CONDUCTOR-VNEXT-PLAN.md` (tracker) → `docs/CONDUCTOR-VNEXT-PLAN.md` (design doc) → this section for F6 handoff detail.

### F6 handoff (s31, manual Claude Code direct — token budget ran out mid-session)

**Committed and pushed (47c7ecb):** engine-side control-plane additions the TUI needs —
`Core/Events/TranscriptLog.cs` (new, mirrors EventLog for agent transcript+thinking), `GET
/transcript/current` SSE, `GET /processes`, `GET /sessions`, `GET /report/query` (SELECT-only),
`POST /inject` (records to run.db's `injections` table — NOT yet consumed into a prompt, that's F8),
and `StateDto` extended with session-level ticker fields + runId/repo/planDir. 644/645 dotnet tests
pass (1 pre-existing Serilog-flush flake, trait-tagged, unrelated).

**NOT committed — sitting on disk at `face/`, first thing the next session must do:**
a full TypeScript + Ink TUI ("the Face" — name taken from the plan file's own architecture comment).
`npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run build` (tsup) ~30ms, `npm test` (vitest) 23/23 passing including
golden-layout snapshot tests at 80×24/120×30/200×50 with a hard "no rendered line exceeds N columns"
assertion. Run `cd face && git add -A && git commit` first, then read the tracker's F6 handoff
paragraph (CONDUCTOR-VNEXT-PLAN.md top) for the two real Yoga/Ink layout bugs the golden tests
caught and how they were fixed — anyone touching `PlanTree.tsx`/`ProcessPane.tsx`/`Layout.tsx` needs
that context before changing row-rendering JSX again.

**What's built:** plan tree (F6.2), agent pane with thinking-stream + tool-fold + search (F6.3),
process pane + 11-verb command palette + tiered ticker (F6.4), PLUS the rest of D11's checklist:
inject editor, prompt/persona template editor (direct filesystem read/write — no engine round-trip),
session-history browser, report/query console. Mouse support via raw SGR (1000+1006) escape parsing
(`src/input/mouse.ts`, unit-tested at the parser level). `--demo` flag runs the whole thing fully
offline against synthetic data generated from this repo's own real tracker — no conductor process
needed (see `face/src/api/demo.ts`).

**What's NOT done / not verified — this is the honest gap, not scope creep to chase blindly:**
1. **Never run against a real `conductor run --control-plane` process.** Only tested against
   `--demo` and component tests with a fake stdout/stdin (real TTY interaction isn't drivable from
   this environment's tools). First thing to do: build the stable driver, run it with
   `--control-plane`, point `conductor-face` (no `--demo`) at it, and watch a real session end to end.
2. **Mouse support never confirmed against a real terminal emulator** — only the SGR escape-sequence
   parser is unit-tested (pure function, `tests/mouse.test.ts`). Needs an actual click in Windows
   Terminal/whatever terminal the owner uses.
3. **No `--no-dashboard`-equivalent audit of whether Face changes anything about headless engine
   runs** — it shouldn't (it's a separate process, opt-in via `--control-plane`), but nobody has
   proven that this session.
4. Per-checkpoint DONE/TODO calls in the tracker table are deliberately left at IN PROGRESS rather
   than DONE until #1 above happens — marking DONE without ever touching a live engine would be
   exactly the "claim vs reality" gap this whole system's Verifier role exists to catch.
5. `npm audit` shows 5 dev-only transitive vulnerabilities (esbuild/vite, via vitest) — not shipped
   in the built CLI, not investigated further, low priority.

**How to see the TUI right now, no engine needed:**
```powershell
cd face
npm install   # first time only
npm run build
node dist/cli.js --demo
```
Or for live mode against a real run: add `--control-plane` to the `conductor run` invocation above
(see "How to run" below), then `node dist/cli.js` (defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:4317`).

## C# coding standards (this codebase)

### Language level: C# 13 / .NET 10
- **Primary constructors** for classes that take dependencies and immediately assign them
- **`record`** for data-only types (VerifierVerdict, AdvisorVerdict, PendingFix) — value semantics, with-expressions
- **`sealed`** by default on all classes that aren't designed for inheritance
- **Collection expressions** `[1, 2, 3]` instead of `new[] { 1, 2, 3 }`
- **Raw string literals** `"""..."""` for SQL and multi-line templates
- **`using var`** for IDisposable resources (SqliteCommand, SqliteDataReader, Process handles)
- **File-scoped namespaces** — `namespace Foo.Bar;` (no braces)

### Async patterns
- **`ConfigureAwait(false)`** on EVERY await in library/engine code (not in test projects)
- **`CancellationToken` threaded everywhere** — no `CancellationToken.None` in async methods
- **`await Task.Delay()`** not `Thread.Sleep()` in async paths
- **No `.Result` / `.Wait()` / `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()`** — sync-over-async is forbidden
- **`async Task` not `async void`** except for event handlers (but there are none)

### Null safety
- **Nullable reference types ON** — `string?`, `int?`, etc. explicit
- **`??` and `?.`** operators for safe navigation
- **Pattern matching** `is { } x` for non-null checks, `is not null` for guard clauses
- **`ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull()`** in public API entry points

### Collections and strings
- **`StringComparer.Ordinal`** / `OrdinalIgnoreCase` for all dictionary lookups and comparisons
- **`StringBuilder`** for multi-append string construction
- **`IReadOnlyList<T>`** for read-only return types; `List<T>` for mutable state
- **`HashSet<string>`** with explicit comparer for lookup sets

### Security and correctness
- **Regex: always use timeout** — `RegexOptions` with `RegexTimeout` from `ProgressConventions`
- **SQL: always parameterised** — no string concatenation in SQL (RunDb uses `@param` syntax)
- **JSON: `System.Text.Json`** not Newtonsoft
- **No secrets in code** — tokens read from env vars

### Analyzer strictness
- **TreatWarningsAsErrors** on the whole solution
- **Meziantou.Analyzer** full ruleset — never lower severity to pass
- **#pragma warning disable** only with inline justification comments, scoped to the minimum block

## Delivery flow (F4+)
- **Deliver session** delivers checkpoints → gates green → **Verifier session** independently checks claims
- Verifier outputs `{score, findings[], verdict}` JSON — score ≥ 80 → DONE; < 80 → findings feed retry
- VerifierThreshold configurable in plan's `LimitsConfig`; per-stage override pending F7
- ShouldVerify gates only `SessionKind.Deliver` — Fix/Audit/Resume sessions skip verification

## Command/Query/Event layering (F5+)
Orchestrator was a 2763-line god-class (design doc C10) mixing the run-loop state machine with
control-verb execution, snapshot building, and lane glue. F5 cut the first seam; keep cutting along
it rather than adding new responsibilities back into Orchestrator:
- **New control verb?** Goes in `Core/Commands/ControlDispatcher.cs` (one `case` in `DispatchAsync`),
  not inline in `Orchestrator.HandleControlAsync`. All three ingresses (TUI queue, control.json,
  `POST /control`) already converge on `ControlCommand` → `ControlDispatcher.DispatchAsync` — a new
  verb written there is automatically available from all three, no per-ingress wiring.
- **New read/query surface?** Build it from the event log (`RunStateProjection.Fold`,
  `Core/Events/TaskGraph.cs`, `Core/SnapshotBuilder.cs`) or extend those, never by reaching into
  `Orchestrator`'s private fields. This is what keeps `Core/Http/ControlPlaneServer.cs`'s GET
  endpoints decoupled from Orchestrator internals — they only ever read `events.jsonl`.
- **HTTP wire types are separate DTOs** (`Core/Http/ControlPlaneDto.cs`), not `DashboardSnapshot`
  directly — the TUI-rendering types carry `ValueTuple` fields System.Text.Json's source generator
  can't serialise. Mapping is a thin field copy; don't duplicate the actual computation.
- **Control plane is opt-in** (`RunOptions.ControlPlane` / `--control-plane` CLI flag, off by
  default) and a bind failure is caught + logged, never fatal — headless/no-flag runs must stay
  byte-identical whether or not it's enabled. Don't add a code path that assumes it's running.
- Still explicitly deferred (documented, not forgotten): `GET /transcript/current` (thinking-stream
  SSE — build with F6's agent pane, the first real consumer).
- **Lane coordination is cut out too** (chore/debt, pre-F6): `StartParallelAudit`/
  `RunFollowupFixLanesAsync`/`StartAnalysisLanes`/etc. now live in `Core/Lanes/LaneCoordinator.cs`,
  not Orchestrator. Same shape as ControlDispatcher — Orchestrator holds a lazily-constructed
  `Lanes` property and only decides *when* to call in; `LaneCoordinator` owns the parallel-audit
  worktree lane, fix-lanes, and the analysis-lane pool. New lane-shaped work goes there.

## Foreground-blocking anti-patterns (codebase-specific)

### Test filtering — use Category traits, not substring guessing
- Every test that spawns a real process/git repo (ProcessSupervisor*, MutatingLane* in
  `B12_3Tests.cs`/`B12_4Tests.cs`, `HarnessTests`, `GateRunnerTests`, `B11_1CrossPlatformShellTests`)
  carries `[Trait("Category", "Integration")]`, at class or method level. The one known-flaky test
  (`EventLogTests.ReadAllSucceedsWhileLiveWriterHoldsTheFile`, a live-file-handle race) carries
  `[Trait("Category", "Flaky")]`. Do not hand-maintain a substring filter list again — a prior
  version of this doc did (`FullyQualifiedName~FailureCircuitBreaker|...`) and it silently missed
  real integration tests whose names didn't match the listed substrings.
- **Fast dev loop** (measured ~8s for 583 tests): `dotnet test Conductor.slnx --filter "Category!=Integration&Category!=Flaky"`
- **Full suite** (measured ~21s for 639 tests as of the pre-F6 debt sweep — much faster than the
  "5+ min" this doc used to claim; re-measure if it regresses): `dotnet test Conductor.slnx`
- New tests that spawn a real process, real git repo, or sleep >500ms for a real OS event: add the
  `Integration` trait when you write them, not after the fact.
- Kill orphan dotnet processes from failed runs: `Get-Process dotnet -ea 0 | Stop-Process -Force`

### ProcessRunner has both sync and async entry points — use the right one
- **Closed (chore/debt, pre-F6):** `ProcessRunner.RunAsync`/`RunShellAsync`/`RunPowerShellAsync`
  now exist (`Process.WaitForExitAsync` instead of the old `WaitForExit(500)` polling loop).
  `GateRunner`/`Advisor` are fully async (`RunAllAsync`/`RunOneAsync`/`RunHookAsync`/
  `ConsultAsync`), and the whole Orchestrator call chain that reaches them (`RunGateBatteryAsync`,
  `ConsultAdvisorAsync`, `RunStageHookAsync`, `RunRemediationAsync`, `EvaluateSessionAsync`,
  `ApplyVerdictAsync`, `EscalateExhaustedStageAsync`, `ConfirmCompletionAsync`) awaits them —
  a multi-minute gate battery or advisor spawn no longer ties up the async run loop's thread-pool
  thread for its whole duration.
- **Use `RunAsync`/`RunAllAsync`/`ConsultAsync`** from any `async Task` engine method (the
  orchestrator loop, lanes, mutating-lane merge gates). **Use the sync `Run`/`RunAll`** only at a
  genuine CLI sync boundary with no concurrent async work to protect (`GateCommand.Execute`,
  `RecentCommits`, `RunAgent` in `Commands.cs`) — same category as the existing
  `#pragma warning disable MA0045 // sync-over-async boundary: Spectre.Cli Execute must return int`
  pattern already used by `RunCommand.Execute`. The analyzer (MA0045/CA1849/MA0042) flags every
  sync call once an async twin exists — pragma-suppress at the boundary rather than threading
  async into a Spectre.Cli `Execute` that must return `int`.

### Agent sessions: use `conductor bg start|status|logs|stop` for long ops
- F2.3 delivered sanctioned background-run primitives for agent prompts
- Prompts must mandate `conductor bg start` for anything >3 min
- StallDetector v2 (F3.1) uses bg liveness as a keepalive signal — "quiet but its backtest
  is running" is NOT a stall

### MCP task server is in-process, not a background process
- `McpTaskServer` runs in the same process as the agent session
- It reads/writes files synchronously — keep operations fast

### PreflightHealth checks can block (DNS timeout, HTTP timeout)
- DNS and HTTP checks have 10s timeouts via CancellationTokenSource
- When preflight is disabled or unconfigured (DnsHealthCheckConfig absent), `RunAllAsync`
  returns empty list and `AnyFailed` returns false — orchestrator proceeds
- Git check spawns `git status --porcelain` synchronously — <1s normally

## Gotchas
- **`claudeSessionId`** is a legacy field name storing ANY agent's session id (B2 renames/abstracts).
- Templates for the self-plan live in `plans/baton-templates/` (NOT `plans/templates/`, which are the
  Loom templates B1 relocates to `examples/loom/`).
- `Conductor.slnx` already exists on master — B0 verifies, doesn't recreate.
- Stage-id convention: the current `TrackerParser` regex does NOT match `P-0` (hyphen) — proven
  against `examples/shamshir/parity-pipeline.TRACKER.md` (16/17 rows). B1.4 makes it configurable.
- Value-only gates/tests (BRIEF §5.1): don't add ceremony; audit fixes leftovers; followups feed the
  next phase / B12 fix-lanes.
