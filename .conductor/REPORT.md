| # | Title | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| F0.1 | Kill list executed — delete replay/time-travel, persona bloat (keep 3 roles), confidence pane, heartbeat commits to feature branch, hierarchical template system | ✅ DONE | [`47798ee`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor/commit/47798ee) |
| F0.2 | Async control loop — Orchestrator run loop async (B4.7 debt); no blocking .Result/.Wait() | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F0.3 | Integration harness — fake agent + temp repo, full cycle asserted (B4.8); gate: 0w/0e, harness cycle green | ⬜ TODO | - |

</details>

<details><summary>F1 — run.db task store + tracker-as-view + task/note verbs (0/4)</summary>

| # | Title | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1.1 | run.db schema — tables: runs, stages, sessions, attempts, gates, scores, ledger, handovers, injections, costs; telemetry per D8 | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F1.2 | Tracker-as-view — conductor writes TRACKER.md FROM run.db (generated view for humans/agents); regenerates byte-stable | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F1.3 | conductor task/note verbs — task CRUD + note (writes ledger); MCP surface; agents report progress via verbs instead of hand-editing markdown | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F1.4 | conductor report --query — ad-hoc SQL/DSL against run.db ("cost of stage R3?", "which gates fail most?") | ⬜ TODO | - |

</details>

<details><summary>F2 — ProcessSupervisor + Job Objects + bg primitives (0/4)</summary>

| # | Title | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| F2.1 | ProcessSupervisor + Job Objects — every child spawned into Windows Job Object; kill-by-tree, no orphans | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F2.2 | PID registry in run.db + orphan reaper at startup | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F2.3 | conductor bg start / status / logs / stop — sanctioned background-run primitive; prompts mandate it for anything >3 min | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F2.4 | MCP bg surface + harness proof — kill-by-tree, orphan reap, bg liveness feeds stall detector | ⬜ TODO | - |

</details>

<details><summary>F3 — Stall v2 + same-failure breaker + pre-flight (0/4)</summary>

| # | Title | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| F3.1 | Stall detection v2 — watches (a) agent stdout, (b) tool-call events from JSON stream, (c) liveness of supervised bg children | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F3.2 | Soft-kill debrief — on stall: inject "wrap up, write ledger + handoff, 3 min grace", kill only after grace window | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F3.3 | Same-failure circuit breaker — 2 consecutive attempts with identical failure signature → Advisor session (not another Deliver) | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F3.4 | Pre-flight health check — DNS/API reachability, disk, git clean, budget remaining; fail → park + Telegram + auto-recheck with exponential backoff | ⬜ TODO | - |

</details>

<details><summary>F4 — Verifier role + scoring loop + findings-as-retry (0/5)</summary>

| # | Title | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| F4.1 | Verifier role — Deliver role + Verify role (fresh context, cheap model); Verify re-runs the checkpoint's truth gate independently | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F4.2 | Score output — JSON {score 0-100, findings[], verdict}; ≥ threshold (default 80) → DONE, findings become follow-up tasks | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F4.3 | Retry-with-findings — score < threshold → findings injected into Retry of Deliver (same model); QA-fix merged into retry (no separate fix session) | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F4.4 | Advisor verdicts honored — structured AdvisorVerdict.Action (BlockRetry/NeedsHuman/SkipStage/RerunGates) honored by orchestrator | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F4.5 | Handoff fact-check — Advisor fact-checks handoffs and human injections against git/log/artifacts; contradictions flagged in prompt | ⬜ TODO | - |

|---|---|---|---|
| F5.1 | HTTP+SSE localhost control plane — endpoints: state, task graph, session transcript stream, thinking stream, control verbs | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F5.2 | control.json verbs exposed over HTTP; event stream same as events.jsonl, served live | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F5.3 | Headless mode unchanged; curl-level contract tests for all endpoints | ⬜ TODO | - |

</details>

<details><summary>F6 — Ink TUI v1 — TypeScript rebuild (0/5)</summary>

| # | Title | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| F6.1 | TS+Ink project scaffold + build split — TUI outside dotnet build; engine incremental <10s (D12) | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F6.2 | Plan pane — tree with per-stage state/score/cost, current highlighted, no truncation at 100+ cols | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F6.3 | Agent pane — live transcript WITH thinking stream, scrollback+search, tool-call folding | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F6.4 | Process pane + command palette (: or Ctrl+K) + ticker (session/run cost, tokens, wall time, gate cache hits) | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F6.5 | Golden-layout snapshot tests at 80×24 / 120×30 / 200×50; TUI crash leaves run alive | ⬜ TODO | - |

</details>

<details><summary>F7 — Plan import + truth gates + speed program (0/5)</summary>

| # | Title | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| F7.1 | Plan import — LLM pass (advisor model) converts mega plan → task graph: stages, sessions, checkpoints, dependencies, truth gates | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F7.2 | Re-import diff — mid-plan changes are a first-class operation (diff, not clobber); interactive confirm/edit table | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F7.3 | Truth-gate tier — per-stage product-level assertions; per-stage gate selection (docs-only stage runs 0 dotnet gates) | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F7.4 | Gate caching by SHA — result = fn(gate, HEAD sha, tier); re-running unchanged battery forbidden by engine, not convention; agents told which gates are already green | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F7.5 | Speed program — solution-filter builds, skipIfFresh attribute, parallel test lanes; target: fast tier ≤60s wall | ⬜ TODO | - |

</details>

<details><summary>F8 — conductor chat + Telegram v2 (0/4)</summary>

| # | Title | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| F8.1 | conductor chat — spawns agent wired (MCP) to run.db+ledger+logs+control verbs: "how did s9 die?", "update task A2", "inject X into retry" | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F8.2 | Telegram v2 — session-end one-liner with score; NeedsHuman ping with inline buttons [Retry] [Skip] [Inject…] [Chat] | ⬜ TODO | - |
| F8.3 | Reply-to-inject + /status from run.db + daily digest; host-free (long-poll getUpdates, works behind NAT) | ⬜ TODO | - |

## Last session result

> SESSION-RESULT: Delivered F0.1 kill list in full — 5 commits across 23 files, deleting 687 net LOC. Replay/Confidence classes deleted entirely, personas trimmed from 9 to 3 (deliver/verify/advise), heartbeat git-commit machinery stripped (report still refreshes to disk), hierarchical template system collapsed to single minimal scaffold. 531 tests pass at 0w/0e. F0.2 (async control loop) and F0.3 (integration harness) remain TODO for next session. Hardest part: tracing deeply-woven kill-list items through 48 source files — the heartbeat removal touched the orchestrator, control-file parser, action-bar renderer, report publisher, progress model, and snapshot builder simultaneously, requiring c…

## Tracker handoff

```
last: s1 — F0.1 kill list executed (replay, confidence, personas, heartbeat, templates deleted). All 5 sub-items DONE.
stage: F0 — Foundations. F0.1 DONE, F0.2 (async loop) next, F0.3 (harness) pending.
commits: 8a57d1e | 9daa9c7 | c305bcf | 7590d71 | 47798ee (5 commits, 23 files, -687 net LOC).
gate: 0w/0e, 531/531 tests pass. dirty: REPORT.md auto-refresh only.
trap: F0.2 requires making Orchestrator.Run() async (~2400 LOC god-class). Start by eliminating Thread.Sleep → Task.Delay and .GetAwaiter().GetResult() in the run loop, then propagate up. F0.1 is locked — do not revisit.
branch: feat/foreman.
