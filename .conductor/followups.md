# Tracked followups

Living list of debt/ratchets deferred out of a phase, each with an owning stage. A later
fix/harden session (or the owning stage's opening) must clear these. Never silently drop a row —
close it with a commit ref or move it, don't delete it.

### Analyzer ratchets (recorded in ADR-0001 §"Deliberately relaxed") — ratchet severity to `error`
| id | rule | sites | why deferred | owning stage | status |
|----|------|-------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| FU-B0-1 | MA0045 (sync-over-async I/O) | ~28 | Async-ifying the Orchestrator is signature-changing and *is* the B2 async/Host/DI rework. The deadlock-class twin MA0042 stays `error`. | B2 | OPEN |
| FU-B0-2 | MA0002 (explicit StringComparer) | ~38 | Cross-cutting, mechanical; low correctness risk under `InvariantGlobalization`. | post-B2 | OPEN |
| FU-B0-3 | MA0009 (regex ReDoS timeout) | ~7 | `TrackerParser` regex (the untrusted-input path) is reworked in B1.4; timeouts land naturally there. | B1.4 | CLOSED (bB1.4) — severity now `error`; every tracker regex carries `ProgressConventions.RegexTimeout` (2s); build green under it. |

Ratchet = flip the `.editorconfig` severity to `error` and fix every resulting site in that stage's
diff. Do NOT delete these rows until the severity is `error` and the build is green under it.

### Test-harness / smoke-loop gaps (found by B0 audit)
| id | item | detail | owning stage | status |
|----|------|--------|--------------|--------|
| FU-B0-4 | `fake-agent.ps1` `gatesred` mode does not make gates actually red | It flips the tracker but skips the commit, so the `--once` verdict is `NoProgress` because **commits=0**, not because a gate failed (`gate build: exit 0` in `docs/baton/evidence/B0.4-gate.txt`). The fix-session path is exercised, but the mode name over-claims. To genuinely exercise a red gate, the smoke plan needs a gate the fake agent can fail (e.g. write a file that breaks `dotnet build`) — needs a smoke-plan design tweak, out of B0's diff budget. | B0 fix-lane / B3 (gate control) | OPEN |
| FU-B0-5 | `--once` smoke leaves the temp worktree dirty | Scenario 1 logs `working tree left dirty after green session: M once-raw.txt`. Harmless for the token-free smoke (temp repo), but a cleaner harness would tidy or gitignore its raw-capture artifact. | B0 fix-lane | OPEN |

### Pre-existing code smells confirmed by B0 (NOT introduced by B0; deliberately not fixed here to honour "no behaviour change" in a TFM-migration stage)
| id | item | location | owning stage | status |
|----|------|----------|--------------|--------|
| FU-B0-6 | Empty `catch { }` swallow in the raw-log writer/disposer (A15) | `src/Conductor/Core/AgentSession.cs:97`, `:253` | B2 (structured logging / error surfacing) | OPEN |
| FU-B0-7 | `CA1031` (catch general) landed at `suggestion` | many legit boundary catches; revisit once structured logging (B2) can surface them | B2 | OPEN |

See `docs/baton/audits/B0-baseline.md` for the full architectural debt inventory (items §1–§12,
each with a file:line and an owning B-stage). Those are the design-level followups the later stages
own directly and are not duplicated here.

## Opened by B1 (audit session, 2026-07-08)

| id | item | detail | owning stage | status |
|----|------|--------|--------------|--------|
| FU-B1-1 | `ScriptProvider` can't split stdout from stderr | `ProcessRunner.Run` interleaves both streams, so a normaliser that writes any progress/warning to stderr corrupts the JSON parse (surfaces as "not a JSON checkpoint array"). Provider stays resilient (clear error, no crash) and the "print ONLY JSON to stdout" contract is documented, but it's brittle. Splitting streams is a `ProcessRunner` signature change → land with structured logging. | B2 | OPEN |
| FU-B1-2 | No `CancellationToken` through `IProgressProvider.Read` | Progress read is synchronous; `ScriptProvider` spawns a process with only a timeout, not the run's CT, so Ctrl+C won't interrupt a long normaliser mid-read. Consistent with FU-B0-1 (sync-over-async deferred); thread the CT with the B2 async/Host/DI pass. | B2 | OPEN |
| FU-B1-3 | `ScriptProvider` trusts checkpoint content shape | Accepts a JSON array with empty ids / unknown status without validation (garbage-in → empty-id rows). Fine for a plan-owned script, but a stricter contract would fail louder. Low priority. | post-B2 | OPEN |

Fixed in-phase by the B1 audit (no followup needed, recorded for the trail): shamshir `new-plan`
scaffold was undrivable (declared `P-0/P0/P1` stages but scaffolded `S1` rows) → now stage-coherent
+ `NewPlanScaffoldTests`; double-space/tab `IN PROGRESS` silently misclassified by the new status
vocabulary → whitespace-tolerant `StartsWithAny` + regression test. See `.conductor/handovers/B1.md`.
